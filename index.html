                        My name is Michael Mayo, II, but you can just call me Mike. I am currently employed in the
                        automotive industry as a technician but have set a goal to change careers by the end of the year.
                        I plan to do that by completing the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp and become a developer.
                        I am very excited to take on this journey I have set myself on and cannot wait to see what the end
                        of it holds for me!<br>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        I'll start with a little history on myself and how I came to this point. I began my adult life
                        serving five years in the US Air Force as an Avionics System Technian on F-16 aircraft. I enjoyed
                        the time I spent in the Air Force but never intended on it being a full career. After separating from
                        the Air Force I went to school at Unviersal Technical Institute and earned an Associate's degree in
                        Automotive Technology. From there I went on to earn seven ASE certifications as well as become an
                        inspector for Virginia's annual state safety inspection, which is required for all vehicles registered in
                        the state of Virginia.<br>
                    </p">
        
                    <p>
                        Since making the transition from the Air Force to the civilian world and working on cars I haven't been
                        challenged in ways I need to be. Day to day work has become very simple and repetitive and I need a career that
                        will allow me to stimulate my mind and enjoy what I do. I have since found out about coding and the
                        development world and have been extremely intrigued by it! With the way technology changes and evolves so quickly I
                        believe I will always have the challenge I need to always enjoy work.<br>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        One of the accomplishments, professional or personal, I am most proud of is hiking the Southern
                        California section of the Pacific Crest Trail. If you've never heard of the Pacific Crest Trail, it runs from the
                        California/Mexico border and winds through California, Oregon, and Washington and finishes eight miles
                        into Canada.  The full trail is over 2,600 miles long! I intended on completing the full length of the trail but was
                        forced to come home due to injuries I could no longer hike on. I hiked through numerours injuries on the trail but
                        ultimately I decided long-term health was more important than finishing something I could always come back to. Hiking
                        700 miles is still a feat in itself and I plan to go back someday and finish what I started!<br>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        With this new career in sight I believe I will have greater oppurtunity to do the things I love outside
                        of work and also make a career which I love. I foresee more flexibility and more oppurtunity for growth than what I have
                        in my current occupation. I am determined to make the most of the new career and will not be looking back!
